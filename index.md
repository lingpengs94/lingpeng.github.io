<h2 style="margin: 60px 0px 10px;">Short Bio</h2>

I am currently on the 2025-2026 academic job market, looking for faculty positions in statistics or biostatistics related to Bayesian inference, joint modeling, variable selection. Please feel free to contact me if you are interested. I am also happy to give talks on my research in related seminars.

I am a seasoned biostatistician with a strong background in Bayesian Nonparametric, Longitudinal, Survival, and joint modeling of data involving multiple types of responses, often grappling with intricate issues like missing data and detection limits. 

To date, my contributions encompass over 58 peer-reviewed articles featured in esteemed biomedical and public health journals and my work has been cited by researchers from all over the world, including Proposed rule by US Food and Drug Administration and presidential advisory statement from American Heart Association. 

In my role as a Biostatistician, I bring forth not only expertise but also a wealth of experience, ensuring the accuracy, security, and reproducibility of data entry. 

Moreover, I possess extensive knowledge in conducting quasi-experimental analyses on large and complex national survey and administrative datasets, aimed at identifying effective policies for controlling substance use and interventions for a variety of behavioral and health outcomes.

## Research Interest:
-  Bayesian inference 
-  Variable selection 
-  Joint Modeling with of data involving multiple types of responses
-  Missing Data
-  Quasi-experimental Design
